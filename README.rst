============================
The Zen of Python by Example
============================

I wrote and presented ``pep20_by_example.py`` in 2011 for RedSnake
Philly, the annual joint meeting between the Philadelphia Python and
Ruby user groups. The text, which at least hopes to be executable
Python, is informal. Most importantly, it is left for the reader to
think, for each section, which example is the good one to follow, and
when.

This text has errors and shortcomings. Corrections and additions are
welcome. Please send them either by pull request to the Github repo at;

or by e-mail to me, Hunter Blanks, via hblanks@artifex.org.

Credit goes to Tom Panzarella for encouraging me to give a talk before
such a large, technical audience, and further for suggesting that it be
on a meta-level topic. Thanks also go to Ka-Ping Yee and Brett Cannon,
who first taught me Python and the Zen of it in 2003.
